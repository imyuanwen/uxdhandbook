        <h1>UX Design<br>Handbook</h1>
        <p>By Yuan Wen</p>

      <p>
        This is an online interactive book that you can find theories and
        tools about User Experience (UX) design.The target audience are people who want to learn UX design.
      </p>
      <h1><a id="intro"></a>Introduction</h1>
      <p>User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and
        relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the
        product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function. -- <em>Interaction Design
          Foundation</em></p>

      <h2 id="uxvshci">UX design & Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</h2>
      <p>HCI is more academic-based and focuses more on research. UX design is more industry-based and focuses more on
        practice. While HCI focuses more on understanding the interaction between human and computers through research,
        UX design focuses more on dictating the rules about how to design a great user experience.</p>
      <h2 id="uxvsucd">UX design & User-centered Design</h2>
      <p>User-centered Design is <strong>a process</strong> in which the needs, wants, and limitations of end users of a
        product are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process. UX design is User-centered. So they
        can exist together.</p>

      <h2>Perception and sensation</h2>
      <p>To represent the world, we must first detect physical energy (a stimulus) from the environment and convert it
        into neural signals. This is a process called <strong>sensation</strong>.</p>
      <p>When we select, organize, and interpret our sensations, this process is called <strong>perception</strong>.</p>
      <p>Top five sensors: sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste.</p>
      <p><strong>Bottom-up Processing</strong>: Analysis of the stimulus begins with the sense receptors and works up to
        the level of the brain and mind.</p>
      <p><strong>Top-Down Processing</strong>: Information processing guided by higher-level mental processes as we
        construct perceptions, drawing on our experience and expectations.</p>
      <p><strong>Feature Detection</strong>: Nerve cells in the visual cortex respond to specific features, such as
        edges, angles, and movement.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Memory</h2>
      <p><strong>Short-term memory (STM)</strong> is the capacity for holding, but not
        manipulating, a small amount of information in mind in an active, readily available state for a short period of
        time. The duration of STM seems to be between 15 and 30 seconds, and the capacity about 7 items.</p>
      <p><strong>Long-term memory (LTM)</strong> is the stage of the Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model where informative
        knowledge is held indefinitely. Theoretically, the capacity of long-term memory could be unlimited, the main
        constraint on recall
        being accessibility rather than availability. Duration might be a few minutes or a lifetime. </p>
      <p><strong>Working memory</strong> is a cognitive system with a limited capacity that is responsible for
        temporarily holding
        information available for processing. Working memory is often used synonymously with short-term memory, but some
        theorists consider the two forms of memory distinct, assuming that working memory allows for the manipulation of
        stored information, whereas short-term memory only refers to the short-term storage of information.</p>

      <h1><a id="principles"></a>Design principles</h1>
      <p>Design principles are fundamental pieces of advice for you to make easy-to-use, pleasurable designs. There are
        some most popular and useful principles identified by different researchers.</p>
      <p><strong>Visibility</strong>: The more visible functions are, the more likely users will be able to know what to
        do next. Incontrast, when functions are "out of sight," it makes them more difficult to find and know how to
        use.</p>
      <p><strong>Affordance</strong>: Affordance is a relationship between objects and the user. It's a perceived
        actionpossibilities. Thus, the affordance of an object depend on the user's physical capabilities and their
        goals and past experiences. For example, a mouse button invites pushing (in so doing acting clicking) by the way
        it is physically constrained in its plastic shell.</p>
      <p><strong>Signifiers</strong>: Don Norman states that "the term signifier refers to any mark or sound, any
        perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a person." A signifier can be anything used to
        indicate what affordances things have.</p>
      <p><strong>Constraints</strong>: It’s an aspect of the design that constrains, or restricts, a user from
        performing a certain action. It’s important to give limitations as a precautionary step to safeguard against
        users doing things you don't intend them to do.</p>
      <p><strong>Mapping</strong>: This refers to the relationship between controls and their effects in the world.
        Nearly all artifacts need some kind of mapping between controls and effects, whether it is a flashlight, car,
        power plant, or cockpit. An example of a good mapping between control and effect is the up and down arrows used
        to represent the up and down movement of the cursor, respectively, on a computer keyboard.</p>
      <p><strong>Consistency</strong>: This refers to designing interfaces to have similar operations and use similar
        elements for achieving similar tasks. In particular, a consistent interface is one that follows rules, such as
        using the same operation to select all objects. For example, a consistent operation is using the same input
        action to highlight any graphical object at the interface, such as always clicking the left mouse button.
        Inconsistent interfaces, on the other hand, allow exceptions to a rule.</p>
      <p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Tolerance</strong>: The design should be flexible and tolerant, reducing the cost of mistakes and
        misuse by allowing undoing and redoing, while also preventing errors wherever possible by tolerating varied
        inputs and sequences and by interpreting all reasonable actions reasonable.</p>
      <p><strong>Feedback</strong>: Feedback is about sending back information about what action has been done and what
        has been accomplished, allowing the person to continue with the activity. Various kinds of feedback are
        available for interaction design-audio, tactile, verbal, and combinations of these.</p>

      <h1><a id="mentalmodel"></a>Mental Model</h1>
      <p>A mental model is what the user believes about the system at hand. A mental model is based on belief, not
        facts. It's a prime goal for designers to make the user interface communicate the system's basic nature well
        enough that users form reasonably accurate (and thus useful) mental models.</p>
