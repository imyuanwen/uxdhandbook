        <h1>UX Design<br>Handbook</h1>
        <p>By Yuan Wen</p>
      </div>
      <p>
        This is an online interactive book that you can find theories and
        tools about User Experience (UX) design.The target audience are people who want to learn UX design.
      </p>
      <h1><a id="intro"></a>Introduction</h1>
      <p>User experience (UX) design is the process design teams use to create products that provide meaningful and
        relevant experiences to users. This involves the design of the entire process of acquiring and integrating the
        product, including aspects of branding, design, usability and function. -- <em>Interaction Design
          Foundation</em></p>

            experience design?</a></li>

      <h2 id="uxvshci">UX design & Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</h2>
      <p>HCI is more academic-based and focuses more on research. UX design is more industry-based and focuses more on
        practice. While HCI focuses more on understanding the interaction between human and computers through research,
        UX design focuses more on dictating the rules about how to design a great user experience.</p>
      <h2 id="uxvsucd">UX design & User-centered Design</h2>
      <p>User-centered Design is <strong>a process</strong> in which the needs, wants, and limitations of end users of a
        product are given extensive attention at each stage of the design process. UX design is User-centered. So they
        can exist together.</p>

      <h2>Perception and sensation</h2>
      <p>To represent the world, we must first detect physical energy (a stimulus) from the environment and convert it
        into neural signals. This is a process called <strong>sensation</strong>.</p>
      <p>When we select, organize, and interpret our sensations, this process is called <strong>perception</strong>.</p>
      <p>Top five sensors: sight, hearing, touch, smell, taste.</p>
      <p><strong>Bottom-up Processing</strong>: Analysis of the stimulus begins with the sense receptors and works up to
        the level of the brain and mind.</p>
      <p><strong>Top-Down Processing</strong>: Information processing guided by higher-level mental processes as we
        construct perceptions, drawing on our experience and expectations.</p>
      <p><strong>Feature Detection</strong>: Nerve cells in the visual cortex respond to specific features, such as
        edges, angles, and movement.</p>

      </ul>
      <h2>Memory</h2>
      <p><strong>Short-term memory (STM)</strong> is the capacity for holding, but not
        manipulating, a small amount of information in mind in an active, readily available state for a short period of
        time. The duration of STM seems to be between 15 and 30 seconds, and the capacity about 7 items.</p>
      <p><strong>Long-term memory (LTM)</strong> is the stage of the Atkinson–Shiffrin memory model where informative
        knowledge is held indefinitely. Theoretically, the capacity of long-term memory could be unlimited, the main
        constraint on recall
        being accessibility rather than availability. Duration might be a few minutes or a lifetime. </p>
      <p><strong>Working memory</strong> is a cognitive system with a limited capacity that is responsible for
        temporarily holding
        information available for processing. Working memory is often used synonymously with short-term memory, but some
        theorists consider the two forms of memory distinct, assuming that working memory allows for the manipulation of
        stored information, whereas short-term memory only refers to the short-term storage of information.</p>

      <h1><a id="principles"></a>Design principles</h1>
      <p>Design principles are fundamental pieces of advice for you to make easy-to-use, pleasurable designs. There are
        some most popular and useful principles identified by different researchers.</p>
      <p><strong>Visibility</strong>: The system status and functions should be visible. Users should be aware of what's
        going on and what can they do.</p>
      <p><strong>Affordance</strong>: Affordance is a relationship between objects and the user. It's a perceived action
        possibilities. Thus, the affordance of an object depend on the user's physical capabilities and their goals and
        past experiences.</p>
      <p><strong>Signifiers</strong>: Don Norman states that "the term signifier refers to any mark or sound, any
        perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a person." A signifier can be anything used to
        indicate what affordances things have.</p>

      <h1><a id="mentalmodel"></a>Mental Model</h1>
      <p>A mental model is what the user believes about the system at hand. A mental model is based on belief, not
        facts. It's a prime goal for designers to make the user interface communicate the system's basic nature well
        enough that users form reasonably accurate (and thus useful) mental models.</p>
